# BoonYah! API, Version 1

# *USAGE / IMPORTANT INFORMATION*

## Introduction:
The BoonYah! Public API contains methods that allow access both via Web-based API's, as well as methods specific to iOS-based native applications.  
Requests use http verbs `GET` and `POST` to handle reading and updating data on the server.  
Responses are all in JSON format.  

Please read the entire document carefully before proceeding with building connections to the API.
## Sandbox Server:
We provide a sandbox environment for testing and development.  The URL is https://mobileshoppingclub.com/api/v1/

For both the sandbox and production URL's, the iOS developer is provided with an API key that is used in the first customer registration request API method.  
This registration method will return two keys, one for use by the iOS app, and another for use by the Kendo application as a webview key.  
The iOS developer is responsible for `POST`ing the webview native key back via WebView, the response of which will be received by the Kendo application.

Kendo: For the sandbox, the Kendo developer will be provided a special sandbox key to be used in place of the `webview_key` that is returned by the initial request.  
But, the sandbox will also work for Kendo with a valid `webview_key` returned by the initial request initiated by the iOS app during hand-off.  This facilitates testing of the application in both scenarios.
## Authentication:
__iOS:__

Authentication will be handled by use of a private key, provided by the backend developer, which is to be hard coded into the production iOS as a secret.
This key will be passed to a registration API method (please see the `Register Device` method in the `Native iOS` section below), in conjunction with an additional datapoint, and a unique token will be returned.
This unique token (`native_key`) is also to be kept secret to the application.
This token will serve as a session/customer account identifer and shall be passed to all other methods in the API in the header as follows:

    AUTHORIZATION: Token token="native_key"
The initial registration is the only method that does not require the token in the header.  All others will return 400 if not present or invalid.

The token shall be enclosed in quotation marks as per above.

The iOS app will also receive back a `webview_native_key` which is to be passed as a POST parameter to the `loadWebView` method that will load the Kendo application in the web view.

The iOS app will have access to the iOS, Customer, and Messages groups, as well as the Default group (for server error reporting).

__Kendo:__

API Document: http://docs.boonyah.apiary.io/
API Blueprint (used to create document on apiary.io): https://raw.github.com/gtcode/boonyah-api/master/apiary.apib
Sandbox token: (Obtain from Paul)
Sandbox API: https://mobileshoppingclub.com/api/v1/

Sandbox API has enabled CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

Authorization for user will be handled by iOS application and using PHP to render token in index.html.  
But for development, you must use the code in Section 1 below to attach the Authorization header to every jQuery ajax request.  
Our production server will substitute the apiDomain and webviewToken using PHP later on.

1) How to set up all AJAX requests using sandbox token

Add this to the Kendo application's index.html directly before closing </head> tag:

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var apiDomain = 'https://mobileshoppingclub.com';
        var webviewToken= 'mySandboxToken';
        function setupAuthorizationForWebView() {
            $.ajaxSetup({
                headers: { 'Authorization': 'Token token="' + webviewToken + '"' }
            });
        }
        setupAuthorizationForWebView();
    </script>
2) Sample API call
    
    jQuery.ajax(apiDomain + "/api/v1/businesses?distance=0.5&sort=alpha&page_number=1&page_size=30", {
        "method": "get",
        "complete": function(data, status){
            alert(JSON.stringify(data));
        }
    });
The Kendo app shall be loaded initially by the iOS application.  
The iOS application initiates a `POST` request to a webview, which will return the Kendo single page app, along with an embedded `webview_key`.
The Kendo app shall immediately plan to attach this returned key to all requests to the API, in the same format as the iOS application (i.e. using AUTH token).

    AUTHORIZATION: Token token="webview_key"
The Kendo app will have access to all methods except the iOS method.
## Pagination:

For Businesses, Offers, and Wallet, pagination is handled by including one or two `GET` parameters in your request.  
When using pagination, you can set the page size, or both the page size and page number.  
This feature is documented in all API methods that use this feature.

### Page Size (e.g. 30 records, first page only):

    https://boonyah.com/api/v1/requestMethod?page_size=30
### Page Size And Page Number (e.g. 30 records, records 31-60, second page only):

    https://boonyah.com/api/v1/requestMethod?page_size=30&page_number=2
Responses that use pagination will include three fields in the response: `page_number`, `page_size`, and `record_count`.  
You may use record count to determine how many total pages of data are available, but please be sure to use the most recent `record_count` in case the dataset changes in between requests.
## Location:

If Geolocation coordinates are not registered with the customer's session, the server will attempt to approximate location based on a reverse IP address lookup.  
The lat/long from this result, or from the **Geolocation** method, will be used, with the ability to override this with a manually-selected lat/long pair (e.g. chosen from a maps interface).
## Customer Authentication:

The customer account will be created or associated automatically by the API server when the registration method is invoked.
Further associations will be permitted via Facebook, Email, and (Keith to confirm) mobile phone.  
Any of these, in a confirmed state (Facebook confirmed, email confirmation link clicked, mobile opted-in), will provide additional features such as saving/redeeming offers.
Before the association occurs, there will be limited usage of the API.

## Versioning:
All API JSON responses will include a key/value that represents the current API and webview revisions in the following form:

        {
            ...
            "api_revision": "a123456b",
            "webview_revision": "a123456b"
        }  

## CSRF Protection:

CSRF Protection is implicit in the use of the custom authentication token that will be passed back by the initial registration method and used in all subsequent API requests.
## Response Status - Success / Error:
### Success
If all is well with a `POST` request, then the response will indicate this as follows:

        {
            "status": "ok"
        }
### Errors
Server-based errors for both `POST` and `GET` requests will receive a 500 level response.  You are expected to handle this gracefully in your client code.

        {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "fatal",
            "error_message": "Error Message - Debug Only - Do Not Display To End User"
        }
Validation errors for `POST` requests will occur as follows:

        {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "validation",
            "error_message": "There Were Errors With Your Form Submission.",
            "validation_errors": {
                "field_2": "Error Message 1",
                "field_2": "Error Message 2",
            }
        }
Errors related to malformed URLs, record not found, etc.:

        {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "400, 404",
            "error_message": "400 - Bad Request OR 404 Not Found - To Be Handled",
        }
Your code should gracefully handle the scenario where a malformed JSON response is received, or no response at all is received (due to connection failure or other issue).
And, your code should also plan to have some form of error reporting that can be passed back to the API, both for errors within your own application, and errors related to unexpected responses from the API.
To handle this, we provide a special method for error reporting.  Please see `Default`, `Error Reporting` at the bottom for further details.
Both the iOS and Kendo applications are expected to use this method throughout the design.

### Response Status Codes:

* 200 - OK [GET], [POST] -- this occurs even if there is a form validation error, in which case you will need to check the 'status' field in the JSON response.
* 400 - Bad Request
* 401 - Not Authorized
* 404 - Not Found
* 500 - Internal Server Error -- this should only happen if there is an error with the server

# *API METHODS*

# Group Native iOS
Native iOS specific resources of the **BoonYah! API**
This group is accessible only by the iOS native application.
UPDATE January 2015 - We will use this for Android as well. Ignore the naming convention of iOS.

## Register Device [/ios/register]
### Send Device Info [POST]
This method is to be used initially by the iOS device to register the device and create or associate with a database customer account.

The private API key, along with a unique identiferForVendor, is to be passed to this method, and a unique usage key will be passed back in the response.  
This key is to be used in all subsequent requests to the API, and shall be passed to the Kendo application for similar usage.

The key may be invalidated at any time simply by requesting a new key using this same method, and the key shall then be passed again to the Kendo application.

If `UIDevice.identifierForVendor` is not present (if using iOS 5.0 or earlier), then please instead create and use a unique hash that is persistent and constant throughout the lifetime of the application installation.

The param "app_version_status" will tell iOS whether the app is current, out of date, or deprecated.  The latest version is also shown in "app_latest_version".
If the user declines a recommended upgrade, iOS or Kendo will call the latest_version that was declined to /settings/declineAppVersion.  If that occurs, as long as there is not a new release, and as long as their current release does not become deprecated, then "app_version_status" will revert to "current".

The key/value pairs inside "webview_theming" contain overrides that are used to theme the Kendo app, and shall be used to also theme iOS in coordination with this.
If a value is blank, then ignore this override and use the internal default.

+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "api_key": "xxx",
            "device_id": "UIDevice.identifierForVendor or a unique per-installation persistent hash (e.g. hash deviceuid with timestamp and random string)",

        }

## APNS [/ios/apns]
### Send APNS Registration Info [POST]
This registration method is required for Boonyah to be able to send asynchronous push notifications to the customer.

Typically it will be the second request made by the native application.
+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "apns_key": "The APNS key that the server will use to send push notifications"
        }

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "status": "ok"
        }

+ Response 201 (application/json)

        {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "invalid_token_format"
        }

## Load Web View [/ios/loadWebView/]
### Load Web View using provided token [GET]
This request is intended to be invoked to any call to open a webview from the native application.  
It contains an action parameter that will be passed back.
IMPORTANT: the url must include the trailing slash, else the resources will not load correctly.  
This was done so as to not disturb the work being performed by the Kendo developer.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        [HTML for Kendo Application, including any necessary state information and with the `webview_key` embedded in the index html as javascript]

## Geofence [/ios/geofence]
### Send Geofence Event [POST]
Boonyah stores all `at` and `leave` geofence events that are received by the iOS application.
Note: this will return validation errors if there are errors in your request format.  
Therefore you MUST check and handle this gracefully in your code, and if validation errors occur, your code MUST then call POST /api/v1/default/errorReporting with debugging information.

If there is a properly configured event on the server, the server will send a push, and send back data per the below sample response.
If there is no event on the server, the response will return 'push_status': 'error', with 'push_status_message' giving an error message, such as 'event not found or configured'.

+ Request (application/json)
        
        {
            "type": "at or leave",
            "time": "XXXX",

        }        
        
## Sighting [/ios/sighting]
### Send Beacon Sighting [POST]
Note: this will return validation errors if there are errors in your request format.  
Therefore you MUST check and handle this gracefully in your code, and if validation errors occur, your code MUST then call POST /api/v1/default/errorReporting with debugging information.

Note: this will return validation errors if there are errors in your request format.  
Therefore you MUST check and handle this gracefully in your code, and if validation errors occur, your code MUST then call POST /api/v1/default/errorReporting with debugging information.
If there is a properly configured event on the server, the server will send a push, and send back data per the below sample response.
If there is no event on the server, the response will return 'push_status': 'error', with 'push_status_message' giving an error message, such as 'event not found or configured'.

The purpose of this is so the server can create the corresponding message in the inbox.
The server will attempt to do so via cron but this should not be relied upon in terms of timing.
This will return 404 if the loyalty_id is not included or is empty.

## Sales Login [/ios/salesLogin]

If the email exists but the password is incorrect, it will also return 'status': 'error' but with 'message': 'Invalid Email Or Password.'.

NOTE: Password Strength Requirement is a very secure 4 character minimum.

        }

### Send Geolocation Info [POST]
This allows the client to send Boonyah the customer's current Geolocation data, both via iOS and browser apps.

If the user has not chosen a location, this method will attempt to choose their location accordingly.

If the geeolocation changes relative to a previous value, you will need to refresh your local data collections asynchronously after this update is confirmed as completed, and/or synchronously as the pages are re-entered in your client application.  

Businesses, Locations, Offers, Prizes, Wallet, and Customer Info will all be affected.

`is_override` controls whether this was chosen manually by the user, i.e. via google maps

`override_active` determines whether the override should be active, this would probably be true if sending a lat/long with `is_override` set to true

# Group QR Code
QR Code related resources of the **BoonYah! API**
## QR Code [/qrcode]
### Send QR Code [POST]
This method is used to send QR code interactions from the dedicated QR Code scanner feature of the app to our server.
At this time, we are using the QR code only for check-ins.
Check-ins may result in a link to our GT or S2W game, and will also optionally result in a Quest checkin.  (qr_code_type == checkin, client to redirect kendo to redirect_url)
If there is no running campaign or not time for a checkin, they'll get linked to the business detail page, or loyalty page, etc.  (qr_code_type == redirect, client to redirect kendo to redirect_url)
If there is no active listing for this QR code, qr_code_type will be not_found and client should handle this gracefully.

# Group Share
Share related resources of the **BoonYah! API**
For the share tracking methods for FB/Twitter/SMS/email:
If the business_id is not included, it will be tracked as a general app share.
If the business_id is included but business is not active or not found, it will throw a 404 and not be tracked.
business_id MUST be included for offer_id or prize_id to be tracked.
Only include offer_id OR prize_id but not both.  offer_id will take precedence.
If offer_id or prize_id is included and not found, 404 and no tracking.
Thus the possible valid combos are:  No keys (still perform a POST though), business_id, business_id & offer_id, business_id & prize_id.
